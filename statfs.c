	 * From a quick survey of f_bsize, f_iosize, and f_frsize on
	 * various NetBSD and Solaris systems, with varying fragment and
	 * block sizes:
	 *
	 *                   f_bsize         f_iosize        f_frsize
	 * netbsd   1k/8k      1024             8192
	 * netbsd   2k/16k     2048            16384
	 * solaris  1k/8k      8192                             1024
	 * solaris  2k/8k      8192                             2048
	 * solaris 512/4k      4096                              512
	 * 
	 * It is apparent that:
	 * 
	 *  - netbsd's f_bsize is equivalent to the fragment size of the
	 *    underlying filesystem
	 *  - netbsd's f_iosize is equivalent to the block size of the
	 *    underlying filesystem
	 *  - solaris's f_bsize is equivalent to the block size of the
	 *    underlying filesystem
	 *  - solaris's f_frsize is equivalent to the fragment size of the
	 *    underlying filesystem
	 *
	 * NetBSD's statfs(2) man page (and sys/mount.h header file) says:
	 *
	 *    long    f_bsize;    /* fundamental file system block size * /
	 *    long    f_iosize;   /* optimal transfer block size * /
	 *
	 * and Solaris's statvfs(2) man page says:
	 *
	 *    u_long  f_bsize;    /* preferred file system block size * /
	 *    u_long  f_frsize;   /* fundamental filesystem block
	 *                           (size if supported) * /
	 *
	 * so it makes sense that their f_frsize == our f_bsize.
	 *
	 * I see that Solaris's sys/statvfs.h says:
	 *
	 *   unsigned long  f_bsize;  /* fundamental file system block size * /
	 *   unsigned long  f_frsize; /* fragment size * /
	 *
	 * but empiric testing (above) seems to indicate that the comments
	 * in their code are wrong.  The following two assignments, even
	 * though they may look wrong, are actually correct.
